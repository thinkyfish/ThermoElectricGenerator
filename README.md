ThermoNuclearGenerator
======================

Simple Thermonuclear Generator for KSP

Looking at the options I really just wanted a Nuclear Generator that behaved more realistically.
The half life and power level can be set from the part.cfg

Yes, time is measured in seconds, so go to wolframalpha.com if you want a different rate.

The default charge rate was based on RTG's being "three to four times as powerful as solar panels" -Wikipedia

#INSTALLATION
