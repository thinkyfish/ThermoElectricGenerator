ThermoElectricGenerator
======================

Simple Thermoelectric Generator mod for KSP.

I wanted more versatile and accurate nuclear power so I created this simple mod.

#Parts
Strontium-90, Plutonium-238, and Polonium-210 generator
-All parts use the stock model by default now.  I have another one, but its ugly.
-See the part.cfg for exact settings for each model.
-All parameters are changeable.

I rebalanced the parts for gameplay over realism using the Ion engine as my reference.
the Pu generator can power one ion engine for 10 kerbin years.
the Po generator can power several at once but will not even power one after 3/4 kerbin years.

#Features
- parts remember when they were installed and use Radioactive decay equation to determine power output.
- all times have been scaled to kerbin years (about a third of earth years)
- Works with 1.0.4, other versions may need a re-compile.

#INSTALLATION
Simply copy the ThermoElectricGenerator folder into your Gamedata
