ThermoElectricGenerator
======================

Simple Thermoelectric Generator for KSP

Looking at the options I really just wanted a Nuclear Generator that behaved more realistically.
The half life and power level can be set from the part.cfg

Yes, time is measured in seconds, so go to wolframalpha.com if you want a different rate.

The default charge rate was based on RTG's being "three to four times as powerful as solar panels" -Wikipedia

#Features
- remembers when it was installed and uses Radioactive decay equation to determine power output.
- Works with .24.x , should work with earlier.

#INSTALLATION
You must copy the RTG models .mu and .mdm files from GameData/Squad/Parts/Electrical/RTG/Parts 
to GameData/ThermoElectricGenerator/BasicThermo/Parts
